# Voxel Engine
This is a personal project to get a better understanding of rust and OpenGL. The goal is to create a voxel engine that can
render a large number of voxels in real time.

## Features
- Chunked multithreaded world generation
- Greedy meshing
- Text rendering
- Line rendering
- Rendering of 3D models

## Planned Features
- Model animation
- Inverse Kinematics
- Infinite world generation
- Lighting
- Shadows
- Water
- Particles
- Physics
